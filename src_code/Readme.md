## packages installation
- Accelerate:
optimizes data loading by automatically creating data loaders that are compatible with distributed training, ensuring that your data pipeline scales efficiently with your hardware.
Uses a configuration file (accelerate config) to store details about your hardware setup, making it easy to switch between different environments (e.g., local machine, cloud, etc.).
Can automatically adjust batch sizes based on the number of available devices, ensuring optimal utilization of resources without manual tuning.
Supports debugging in distributed environments, enabling you to troubleshoot and iterate on your models more efficiently.
And tons of other uses, but those are the most important features for the installation package.

- bitsandbytes:
The package includes optimized implementations of 8-bit matrix multiplication operations, which are crucial for deep learning tasks. These operations are designed to be highly efficient and are compatible with various hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs).
integrates seamlessly with PyTorch, allowing you to leverage 8-bit matrix multiplications in your neural network layers without needing to modify your model architecture.

- transformers:
transformers supports zero-shot and few-shot learning setups, enabling models to generalize to new tasks or languages with minimal training data.
The transformers library offers access to hundreds of pre-trained models, including BERT, GPT, GPT-2, GPT-3, RoBERTa, T5, BART, and many more. Therefore, it gives the ability to easily use one of these open-source models to test as a baseline model.
PyTorch and TensorFlow: The transformers library supports both PyTorch and TensorFlow, allowing you to work with the deep learning framework of your choice. You can easily switch between frameworks without changing your model code.

- trl:
provides a high-level API that simplifies the process of applying RL to transformers, making it accessible even to users who may not be familiar with reinforcement learning.
